          balances are correct. This every sister of the Bene Gesserit knows. To
          begin your study of the life of Maud'Dib, then, take care that you
          first place him in his time: born in the 57th year of the Padishah
          Emperor, Shaddam IV. And take the most special care that you locate
          Maud'Dib in his place: the planet Arrakis. Do not be deceived by the
          fact that he was born on Caladan and lived his first fifteen years
          there. Arrakis, the planet known as Dune, is forever his place.”</em

        <em>
          “Thus spoke St. Alia-of-the-Knife: “The Reverend Mother must combine
          the seductive wiles of a courtesan with the untouchable majesty of a
          virgin goddess, holding these attributes in tension so long as the
          powers of her youth endure. For when youth and beauty have gone, she
          will find that the place-between, once occupied by tension, has become
          a wellspring of cunning and resourcefulness.”
