        <h3>
          "There's unknown all around at every moment. That's where you seek
          knowledge"
        </h3>
        <p>
          Also known as Usul, Mahdi, Lisan al-Gaib and the Kwisatz Haderach,
          Paul is the son of Duke Leto and Lady Jessica and older brother of
          Alia. He is a thoughtful young man of extraordinary talents. At 15
          years of age, Paul has already developed impressive cognitive and
          physical skills, receiving training from a number of his father’s
          trusted advisors—Mentat Thufir Hawat, weapons master Gurney Halleck,
          sword master Duncan Idaho, and Suk doctor Wellington Yueh. Paul also
          shows talent and discipline when his mother teaches him Bene Gesserit
          practices, surpassing the dangerous gom jabbar test when tested by
          Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother Mohiam. Despite his personal losses
          after the Harkonnen attack on Arrakis, Paul succeeds in surviving as a
          fugitive in the harsh Arrakeen desert by winning the loyalty of the
          Fremen. His exposure to the mind-altering spice that grows richly in
          the desert propels him into a higher awareness, allowing him to see
          possible futures. Paul’s new skills of foresight help him to provide
          the Fremen with political purpose and spiritual strength while also
          providing himself with the self-assurance he requires to take control
          of his destiny—or to at least try to. He also proves himself a wise
          leader who can inspire other people to freely pledge their lives to
          him. In only a few years, Paul evolves into the religious savior and
          military leader prophesized by the Fremen and the Bene Gesserit order.
          After completing the Fremen Water of Life ritual, he is able to access
          male and female ancestral memories as well as see future pathways.
          This ability to bridge past and present helps Paul to successfully
          overcome Imperial and Harkonnen forces to take the Imperial throne
          from Emperor Shaddam IV. However, Paul feels trapped in his role of
          Lisan al-Gaib and Kwisatz Haderach through the certainties of his life
          path that he foresees. His public identity has grown too much to allow
          him the simple life that he craves to share with the Fremen woman that
          he loves, his concubine Chani.

        <h3>"My duty is the strength of the tribe. That is my only duty"</h3>
        <p>
          A Fremen leader who challenges and then accepts Paul Atreides and Lady
          Jessica into his sietch, or Fremen community. He is a wise and capable
          leader who is so respected by his people that he is widely considered
          to be the voice of Fremen. He always places the interest of his people
          before his own, a quality that Paul admires greatly. When Paul rises
          to become the Fremen’s promised Mahdi of legend, Stilgar becomes one
          of his most trusted generals.

        <h3>"Words are such gross machinery, so primitive and ambiguous"</h3>
        <p>
          Alia Atreides is Paul’s Atreides’s teenage sister. She is feisty,
          precocious, and highly sexually awakened for her age. Lady Jessica had
          been pregnant with Alia when she became a Reverend Mother. As a
          result, Alia was born with the power to understand her mother’s
          psychological state and wisdom. However, she is not equipped with the
          power to see the future, as Paul is. Throughout Dune Messiah, Dune’s
          pilgrims worship Alia, considering her to be a goddess. She resents
          their reverence for her, though, and often longs for a normal life.
          While the Guild conspiracy considers arranging for Paul and Alia to
          mate so that they can create the Bene Gesserit heir that they want,
          Alia finds herself attracted to the conspiracy’s ghola, Hayt. At the
          end of Dune Messiah, after Hayt becomes Duncan Idaho and Paul has run
          into the desert to die, the novel implies that Alia and Duncan Idaho
          begin a relationship.
