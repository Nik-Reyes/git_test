          Also known as Usul, Mahdi, Lisan al-Gaib and the Kwisatz Haderach,
          Paul is the son of Duke Leto and Lady Jessica and older brother of
          Alia. He is a thoughtful young man of extraordinary talents. At 15
          years of age, Paul has already developed impressive cognitive and
          physical skills, receiving training from a number of his father’s
          trusted advisors—Mentat Thufir Hawat, weapons master Gurney Halleck,
          sword master Duncan Idaho, and Suk doctor Wellington Yueh. Paul also
          shows talent and discipline when his mother teaches him Bene Gesserit
          practices, surpassing the dangerous gom jabbar test when tested by
          Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother Mohiam. Despite his personal losses
          after the Harkonnen attack on Arrakis, Paul succeeds in surviving as a
          fugitive in the harsh Arrakeen desert by winning the loyalty of the
          Fremen. His exposure to the mind-altering spice that grows richly in
          the desert propels him into a higher awareness, allowing him to see
          possible futures. Paul’s new skills of foresight help him to provide
          the Fremen with political purpose and spiritual strength while also
          providing himself with the self-assurance he requires to take control
          of his destiny—or to at least try to. He also proves himself a wise
          leader who can inspire other people to freely pledge their lives to
          him. In only a few years, Paul evolves into the religious savior and
          military leader prophesized by the Fremen and the Bene Gesserit order.
          After completing the Fremen Water of Life ritual, he is able to access
          male and female ancestral memories as well as see future pathways.
          This ability to bridge past and present helps Paul to successfully
          overcome Imperial and Harkonnen forces to take the Imperial throne
          from Emperor Shaddam IV. However, Paul feels trapped in his role of
          Lisan al-Gaib and Kwisatz Haderach through the certainties of his life
          path that he foresees. His public identity has grown too much to allow
          him the simple life that he craves to share with the Fremen woman that
          he loves, his concubine Chani.

          A Fremen leader who challenges and then accepts Paul Atreides and Lady
          Jessica into his sietch, or Fremen community. He is a wise and capable
          leader who is so respected by his people that he is widely considered
          to be the voice of Fremen. He always places the interest of his people
          before his own, a quality that Paul admires greatly. When Paul rises
          to become the Fremen’s promised Mahdi of legend, Stilgar becomes one
          of his most trusted generals.

          Alia Atreides is Paul’s Atreides’s teenage sister. She is feisty,
          precocious, and highly sexually awakened for her age. Lady Jessica had
          been pregnant with Alia when she became a Reverend Mother. As a
          result, Alia was born with the power to understand her mother’s
          psychological state and wisdom. However, she is not equipped with the
          power to see the future, as Paul is. Throughout Dune Messiah, Dune’s
          pilgrims worship Alia, considering her to be a goddess. She resents
          their reverence for her, though, and often longs for a normal life.
          While the Guild conspiracy considers arranging for Paul and Alia to
          mate so that they can create the Bene Gesserit heir that they want,
          Alia finds herself attracted to the conspiracy’s ghola, Hayt. At the
          end of Dune Messiah, after Hayt becomes Duncan Idaho and Paul has run
          into the desert to die, the novel implies that Alia and Duncan Idaho
          begin a relationship.

          A compassionate but doomed noble leader, the Duke is Head of House
          Atreides. He is a hardworking and responsible commander who dearly
          loves his concubine, Lady Jessica, and son, Paul. He is well-regarded
          by his people and the other Great Houses, except for House Harkonnen
          who are mortal enemies to the Atreides. From the novel’s beginning,
          the Duke’s fate is sealed for an early death at the hands of Baron
          Harkonnen. In collusion with the Baron, the Emperor Shaddam IV assigns
          the Duke to govern Arrakis. It is a desolate yet valuable planet due
          to its unique production of the spice drug. The Duke knows he is
          likely walking into a trap but takes up leadership on Arrakis anyway;
          perhaps he views the Arrakeen spice profits as outweighing the
          approaching danger. As predicted, the Duke meets his death shortly
          after taking up his post on Arrakis. He has been betrayed by one of
          his most trusted staff, Dr. Wellington Yueh, who drugs and captures
          him. Dragged before Baron Harkonnen and knowing that he will be
          murdered shortly, the Duke’s final cares are for his family as he
          sacrifices his life in an attempt to kill the Baron. He dies without
          knowing that Jessica is pregnant with their daughter, Alia. The Duke’s
          legacy as an honorable and compassionate leader is overshadowed by the
          immense exploits of his son, Paul, who develops into a messiah-figure
          for a number of key groups in the Imperium and wins the Imperial
          throne.
