            <dd>Alia is raised in a community of Fremen, led by her brother in an effort to control the planet and its production of melange. Alia is captured and Leto is killed in a Sardaukar raid on the sietch; she is presented to the Padishah Emperor Shaddam Corrino IV, who notes that she had been "in command of one of the attacking groups" of Fremen rebels ("mostly of women, children, and old men") that nearly decimated his raiding party. Mature far beyond her four years, Alia escapes during the final battle of Arrakeen, but not before poisoning her grandfather, Baron Harkonnen, with a deadly gom jabbar. Afterwards, she wanders the battlefield of Arrakeen killing fallen Sardaukar and Harkonnen soldiers with a crysknife, earning her the holy epithet "St. Alia of the Knife."

    <h3>From The Tabla Memorium</h3>
    <p>Such a rich store of myths enfolds Paul Muad'dib, the Mentat Emperor, and
      his sister, Alia, it is difficult to see the real persons behind these veils. But
      there were, after all, a man born Paul Atreides and a woman born Alia.
      Their flesh was subject to space and time. And even though their oracular
      powers placed them beyond the usual limits of time and space, they came
      from human stock. They experienced real events which left real traces upon
      a real universe.
      To understand them, it must be seen that their catastrophe was the
      catastrophe of all mankind. This work is dedicated, then, not to Muad'dib or
      his sister, but to their heirs -- to all of us.</p>

    <p>There exists no separation between gods and men: one blends softly casual
      into the other</p>
